# Decision making process

ANGO commitee currently seeking an approach for standardized decision-making framework to streamline processes and ensure transparency for major decisions.
To address these concerns and promote more effective collaboration, I propose the adoption of the DACI decision-making framework.

## DACI decison framework

The DACI framework is a structured decision-making model that clarifies roles and responsibilities for decisions. It is particularly effective for collaborative groups like the ANGO committee, where alignment among diverse members is crucial.

DACI stands for:

- Driver: The individual responsible for driving the decision forward, ensuring progress, and facilitating the process.
- Approver: The person (or group) with final authority to approve the decision.
- Contributors: Individuals or groups who provide input, expertise, or perspectives to inform the decision.
- Informed: Stakeholders who must be kept updated about the decision and its outcome.

### How DACI Works:

1. Identify the key decision to be made.
2. Assign roles to ensure clarity on who is driving, contributing, approving, and being informed.
3. Document the process to create a decision register for accountability and future reference.
4. Communicate the decision to all relevant stakeholders.

A demo document in word, demostrate the process.

### Considerations for Adopting DACI in ANGO

#### Defining Scope:

Clarify which types of decisions (e.g., major projects, financial commitments, or ensemble creation) will require the DACI framework.
Smaller or routine decisions may not need this structure.

#### Role Assignment:

Agree on how roles (Driver, Approver, Contributors, Informed) will be assigned for different decisions.
The Approver role could rotate for fairness or remain fixed for consistency.

#### Decision Register:

Create and maintain a shared folder to track all decisions.
Include fields like: Decision Title, Driver, Approver, Contributors, Status, and Rationale.

#### Training and Awareness:

Introduce the DACI framework to all committee members and provide examples of how it applies to ANGOâ€™s needs.

#### Pilot Phase:

Implement DACI on a trial basis for 1-2 key decisions to assess its effectiveness before full adoption.

#### Feedback Mechanism:

Collect feedback from committee members to refine the process.
